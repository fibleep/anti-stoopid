# Anti Stoopid

Are you tired of being distracted by unnecessary tabs while working on your computer? If yes, then it's time to remove the stoopid from your workflow with the help of the Anti Stoopid app!

To get started, simply take a screenshot of the logo of any app that distracts you and add it to the `stoopids` list in the app. Once you run the script, the app will automatically close all unwanted tabs and help you stay focused on your work.

Note: If you're using Ubuntu, make sure to change to Ubuntu on xorg when logging in as PyAutoGUI won't work otherwise.

Don't let distractions take over your workflow - use Anti Stoopid and stay focused!
